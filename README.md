# EarlPalisocNicerShop
Assignment 2 - Graphical and Wireless Programming Section 2 

## Description
This project is a continuation of the previous assignment, the project title being "EarlPalisocShop". This is largely an improvement
on the previous project's functions, which was to allow the user to browse through a catalog of shop items, choose the desired
quantity for each, and finally checkout with the calculated total price. Improvements to the app were made, including a revamp of
the code using a model for the items, implementing RecyclerView, the appropriate listeners, a Floating Action Bar and finally a menu. 

The menu in particular that would be implemented is an option menu. This would allow the user to navigate through their account, 
check settings, and also display a list of the orders in their cart when implemented. Another concept would be to add contextual menu
that could appear when the image items are clicked on.

## Emulator

This application will support Nexus 5X API 28 x86 (Android 9, API 28) 
However, majority of the testing was eventually done using a physical device, Samsung SM-G930W8 (Android 8.00, API 26)

## Project Status
This app was generally a rushed improvement of the previous assignment. Many changes were made and refactoring the project took up
more time than it should. Additionally, there were some complications when it came to working on the project at home. The emulator 
that was previously set up on my home desktop would run into huge problems and constantly crash. I eventually settled with connecting
a physical android device. 

One major block during the process was attempting to properly utilizing save and destroy states. 
Additionally, issues came up when attempting to implement the options menu and the up navigation. The code would present errors,
and both option menu and up navigation would not appear on the toolbar. 
Going forward, I will attemptto properly implement this to fully complete the app, in addition to adding more items.
